# ModelUN
A simulation of the iterated Peace War game

Teams will be responsible for creating a Delegate, the ambassador to be sent 
to the Model UntiedNations. A delegate to the Untied Nations General Assembly 
needs to be able perform four operations. The country must be able to declare 
its name, record the wealth of all nations, declare war, and receive other
countries declarations of war.

The first meeting of the General Assembly starts with a roll call. The 
delegates will each declare the name of the country they represent. After the 
roll call, the current wealth of each country will be tallied and reported to 
the delegates. Next, a silent, binding poll will be taken in which each 
country will record their wish to go to war with each other country. Once the 
poll is taken, wars will be announced. The meeting will then end.

After all wars are fought, the resource distribution will be tallied and
another meeting will be called.
